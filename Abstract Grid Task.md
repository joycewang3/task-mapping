# Procedure
## Steps
1. Participants were told that the study was concerned with processesinvolved in social interaction. They were presented with a sequence of 10 puzzle pictures containing hidden animals. Each picture was shown for 30 stogether with the names of four target animals that participants were asked to find by pointing. The order of presenting pictures was the same in all conditions. 
2. Participants performed the task either individually or in pairs,and the experimenter corrected any target identification errors. As a dis-tracter task after this encoding phase, each person worked alone for 5 minto solve a word search task.
3. Next, participants were asked for written free recall of the targets. They were given 3 min to complete this task, which they performed individually in separate rooms. 
4. All participants then spent 2 min working individuallyon a distractor task that involved letter cancellation, after which they were given a further 3 min for a second free recall of the targets. On this critical retention trial, participants recalled either individually or in pairs. Those who recalled as a pair having previously encoded as a pair did so with the same partner. Pairs were encouraged to collaborate. 
5. No instructions were given about how to resolve disagreements. One member of each pair acted as a scribe. 
6. Immediately after the second recall, each person worked alone for 3 minon a distractor task in which they had to produce as many four letter wordsas possible from a given set of nine letters. The letters were such that none of the target words could be produced in this task.
7. Finally, all participants were given 3 min for free recall of the targets a third time working as individuals. At the end of the experiment, all participants were debriefed

## Roles 
In group tasks, a scribe wrote down the answers that the group came up with 

## Instructions
Not Available

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
The numbers of correct items on each trial were obtained forall recall protocols. For comparisons involving collaborating pairs, nominal pairs were formed from random combinations of participants who recalled alone. Recall scores for nominal pairs were obtained by combining the individual recall protocols and allowing for any redundant items thatappeared in both. 

## Incentives
Participants were paid volunteers but payment is unknown
